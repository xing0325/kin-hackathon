// Package rerank composes ordered policies that transform a Candidate slice
// into the final display order.
//
// The reranker is intentionally dumb: it runs the policies in the order the
// caller supplied, then truncates to the configured limit. Each policy is a
// pure transform — given a slice it returns one. Cross-policy state is not
// supported; if a policy needs to know which positions were already touched
// it should infer this from candidate reasons or its own indexing.
